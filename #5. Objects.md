# Objects
Objects in JavaScript have properties and things they can do (methods).

## Object Literals
- We use curley braces to create an object using object literal notation. In the object we have key and value pairs, on the left we have a key and on the right a value and they are seperated by a colon. 

```
let user = {
    name: 'bradley',
    surname: 'mubenga',
    hobbies: ['gaming', 'hokey', 'eating'],
};
```

## Methods
- We use methods which are basically functions in objects that allow it to do specific things. You can add a method by adding a key of the method and a function as the value.

```
let user = {
    name: 'bradley',
    surname: 'mubenga',
    hobbies: ['gaming', 'hokey', 'eating'],
    logIn: function() {
        console.log('I am a user method!');
    },
    logOut: function() {
        console.log('I am a user logOut method');
    }
};

user.logIn();
```

- To access keys and values in our object and use them in methods we use the `this` keyword. The `this` keyword is a context keyword that will give you different values depending where the code is executed (scope?).
```
let user = {
    name: 'bradley',
    surname: 'mubenga',
    hobbies: ['gaming', 'hokey', 'eating'],
    logHobbies: functions() {
        this.hobbies.forEach(hobbie => {
            console.log(hobbie);
        });
    };
};

user.logHobbies();
```

- Regularly we will use array of objects to send data from servers to the front end. In this example we switch up the array with an array of objects and then displaying each objects title and likes to the console.
```
let user = {
    name: 'bradley',
    surname: 'mubenga',
    hobbies: [
        {title: Hello, likes: 30},
        {title: Wassup, likes: 40}
    ],
    logHobbies: functions() {
        this.hobbies.forEach(hobbie => {
            console.log(hobbie.title, hobbie.title);
        });
    }
};

user.logHobbies();
```

## Math Object
- JavaScript has many ready made objects for us to use, one of them is the `Math` object. For example below we can find the pi value.

```
console.log(Math.PI);
```

- For example we can round off or floor our number by using the following.
```
const area = 7.7;
console.log(Math.round(area)); // Rounded of number
console.log(Math.floor(area)); // 7
console.log(Math.ceil(area)); // 8
console.log(Math.trunc(area)); // 7
```

- We can generate random numbers using the `.random()` method.
```
const random = Math.random();
console.log(random);
```

## Primitive & Reference Types

### Primitive Types
- Numbers
- Strings
- Booleans
- Null
- Undefined
- Symbols

### Reference Types
- All Types Of Objects
    - Object literals
    - Arrays
    - Functions
    - Dates
    - All Other Objects

The difference between `primitive types` and `reference types` is in the way they are stored in memory. When we create a primitive value it is stored in the `stack`, it is just a stack of things in memory. However when we store reference types it is stored in a `heap`, the `stack` is slower than a `heap`.
